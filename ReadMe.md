## Description

_This tool will create and store settlement information for live entertainment venues_

It will capture information for the following data:

1) Bands playing
2) Date playing
3) Total income from ticket sales
4) Total income from bar sales
5) Present the current stipulation for payout
  a) Is it a guaranteed payout?
  b) Is it a door split?
    * What's the percentages?
      * House % - 10%
      * Bands % - 90%
        * This could be then further split amongst the bands in any combination. Typically this is an even split, but sometimes the headliner band may get more and the opening band may get less.
        For example:
        * Headliner = 50%
        * Support (middle band) = 30%
        * Opener band = 20%
        If $1000 total is brought in
        House = $100, then $900 is split amongst the Bands, given our example:
        Headliner = $450
        Support = $270
        Opener = $180
         

    * What's the total over multiple dates?
